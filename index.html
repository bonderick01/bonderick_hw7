            residents. I worked there for about a year. My second job was working at Hy-Vee as a produce clerk.

          <p>
            During my time at the Univeristy of Iowa, I have been able to work on several different projects
            all varying in skills to differentiate my skillset. In database management, I was able
            to use SQL to create a web application displaying NFL teams success in the last 30 years.
            In data wrangling, i used a similar dataset to create a report determining which NFL team was the most 
            successful in the last decade based on statistics and playoff appearences. In information visualization,
            I was able to create a dashboard, with a bunch of graphs of different NFl teams statistics, and be 
            able to forecast potential statistics for the next season. Finally, in data mining, i worked with a team
            to create a forecasting model based on MLB pitchers statistics. Out model was able to give a prediction if 
            a certain pitcher would win the Cy Young award, based on prior statistics and trends. Each of these projects
            were focused on a different coding language or program.
